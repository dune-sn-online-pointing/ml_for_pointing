BEST MODELS - SN-TPS Neural Networks
Last Updated: November 16, 2025
================================

1. MAIN TRACK IDENTIFIER (MT)
------------------------------
Best Model: v10_corrected_50k
Architecture: Simple CNN (single plane X)
Performance: 91.4% accuracy
Training: 50k balanced samples (ES+CC)
Location: /eos/user/e/evilla/dune/sn-tps/neural_networks/mt_identifier/v10_corrected_50k/
Notes: Trained with corrected data structure, balanced classes

Latest: v21_50k (Nov 16, 2025)
Performance: 91.0% accuracy
Training: 50k balanced samples with history persistence
Location: /eos/user/e/evilla/dune/sn-tps/neural_networks/mt_identifier/v21_50k/
Notes: Includes training history saving feature, similar performance to v10


2. ELECTRON DIRECTION (ED)
---------------------------
Best Model: v26_50k_corrected
Architecture: Three-plane CNN (U/V/X matched)
Performance: Mean angular error ~54.8°, Median ~38.9° (before NaN crash at epoch 73)
Training: 50k ES+CC matched samples
Location: /eos/user/e/evilla/dune/sn-tps/neural_networks/electron_direction/three_plane_three_plane_v26_50k_corrected_20251114_210825/
Notes: Training stopped early due to NaN loss. Best checkpoint around epoch 56 (mean ~89.9°)

Latest: v50_100k (Nov 16, 2025)
Performance: Mean 49.9°, Median 33.5°
Training: 100k ES samples, 68 epochs, no hyperopt
Location: /eos/user/e/evilla/dune/sn-tps/neural_networks/electron_direction/three_plane_three_plane_v50_100k_20251115_232348/
Status: WORSE than expected - needs hyperopt (v14 with hyperopt achieved 25° @ 68% quantile)

Current: v52 (running with hyperopt) - attempting to match v14 performance


3. CHANNEL TAGGING (CT)
------------------------
Best Model: v42_corrected_100k
Architecture: Single-plane volume CNN (X plane)
Performance: 65.3% validation accuracy (epoch 48)
Training: 100k volume images (1m x 1m, 208x1242 pixels)
Location: /eos/user/e/evilla/dune/sn-tps/neural_networks/channel_tagging/v42_corrected_100k/20251114_213453/
Notes: Classifies ES/CC/NC using single plane volumes

Current: v60 three-plane (just submitted, Nov 16 05:07)
Architecture: Three-plane volume CNN (U/V/X matched)
Training: 50k volumes with three planes
Location: TBD (training in progress)
Status: Expected to improve over v42 by using all three planes
Job: 12913042 (running)


================================
SUMMARY OF CURRENT SITUATION
================================

MT: STABLE - v10/v21 both ~91% accuracy, production ready

ED: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
  - v50 (100k, no hyperopt): 49.9° mean - WORSE than v14
  - v14 (with hyperopt): 25° @ 68% quantile - BEST RESULT
  - v52 (with hyperopt): Currently training to recover performance
  - Problem: Training without hyperopt degrades performance significantly

CT: EVOLVING
  - v42 (single plane): 65.3% validation accuracy - current baseline
  - v52 (batch reload): Currently training (3+ hours)
  - v60 (three planes): Just submitted - expected to improve over v42
  - Strategy: Three-plane approach should capture more spatial information
