## Notes

- **ED v14**: Three-plane input, 10k samples
  - Hyperparameter optimization performed
  - Performance: 25° @ 68% quantile on validation set
  - Status: Satisfactory for current needs
  
- **MT v27**: Simple CNN architecture, 200k balanced samples (100k ES + 100k CC)
  - Binary classification: ES vs CC main track identification
  - Training dataset: nov11 cluster images (128×32 pixels)
  - Fixed data leakage with file-level 75/15/10 split, early stopping patience 50
  - Corrected energy metadata (cluster_energy_mev from column 10)

- **CT v42**: 100k balanced samples (50k per class), corrected data
  - 4 conv layers, 64 filters, batch norm
  - 49 epochs trained, stopped at validation plateau
  - Performance: 67.1% train / 65.3% validation accuracy  
  - Status: Needs deeper architecture or more data for improvement
